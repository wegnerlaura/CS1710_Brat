So I,"Always on my mind (Every day, every night)

Say that I like singing these songs you left behind
And I know you always said, ""It's okay to cry""
So I know I can cry, I can cry, so I cry
Wish I'd tried to pull you closer
You pushed me hard, made me focus
Your words, brutal, loving, truthful
I was petrified
You're a hero and a human
Track was done, I'd make excuses
You'd say, ""Come on, stay for dinner""
I'd say, ""No, I'm fine"" (Now I really wish I'd stayed)

Things you'd suggest, ""Make it faster""

Hello goodbye,"I don't know what's going on
Most of the time I'm out my mind
A nervous wreck
I said, ""Goodbye,"" and not ""Hello""
Don't even know
Felt a little fear and some anxiety
The second you arrived and kind of smiled at me
My heart began to rise
I panicked quietly, so silently
I said, ""Goodbye"" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I was too scared, I should have said
""Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello""
I said, ""Goodbye"" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I fеlt too scared, I should have said
""Hello, hеllo, hello, hello, hello, hello""
Now I'm all up in my head
Replaying all my worst regrets
I shot myself, I'm born to lose
Now all I do is think 'bout you
Felt a little fear and some anxiety
The second you arrived and kind of smiled at me
My heart began to rise
I'm freaking quietly, so silently (Ooh)
I said, ""Goodbye"" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I was too scared, I should have said
""Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello""
I said, ""Goodbye"" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I felt too scared, I should have said
""Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello""
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
Goodbye
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
Goodbye
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
I really don't know why-y-y-y
I said, ""Goodbye"" before you came
I turned around and ran away
I was too scared, I should have said

I said, ""Goodbye"" before you came
I turned around and ran away

Got thеir custom on, hit the worst dressed list
Yeah, you better not slide, not slip, not trip
'Cause I poured a load of gasoline on the carpet
Lit a cigarette, took a drag, then I just flicked it
Place went boom, boom, boom, boom, clap
And I just laughed when the bodies went splat
Yeah, I knew I'd end up with my hands behind my back
In a police car, blue and red sirens
(Ayy) All flash, flash, flash, flash, lights and cameras everywhere
(Ayy) Now I'm on the news with the DUI stare

Maybe if you give me that prize
You might see a tear from my eye
Might change my whole damn life
I-I-I'd maybe thank God on the stage
Yeah, I swear I'd be so nice
No, I'd never misbehave
And I'd do my speech on time, maybe somethin' just like

360 featuring robyn & yung lean,"They-they-they all wanna sound like me
All wanna be like Lean
Dress so fresh and so clean
Rock with the diamonds on the sleeve
Breathing in the Stockholm breeze
Get with Robyn on the beat (Uh)
Ayy, get with Robyn on the beat (Sweet)
Cameras flashing, hit the scene
With Robyn and Charli, pull up to the party
Three white lines split the lime and the Barcardi
Icons in the flesh, you're just a demon at a party
Mayor of my town, David Beckham in the noughties
Yeah, I hear it calling
Pick it up, darling, London calling
When I go prancing, yeah, I go all in
Hey, why you do it so cold?
I'm the realest ever, yeah

Killin' this shit since 1994
Got everybody in the club dancing on their own

Right over here
I'm in my Elvis moment, push up on it

Got that really very special language, no one understands it
Three child stars out here doing damage
Me and Lean and Robyn, we don't even have to practice
We got many hits, get you feeling nostalgic
I started so young, I didn't even have email
Now my lyrics on your booby
Baby on my arm
Your favorite pop star is into me, Yung Lean, and Charli
Know you wanna dream like Lean, wanna be like Lean
But it's not as easy as it seems
Who do I trust? Me
We put this shit together so carelessly
Hey, why you do it so cold?
They say I'm the realest ever, yeah
That's what I've been told
Killin' this shit since 1994
We do this one night, yeah, we do it for our lives

Silver scratch card in the canal
Romantic like six-pound wine
Dark in the park, Celtic graves
Girl throws up from the back of a Lime
Headphones on, I hit play
All things change in the blink of an eye
Charli calls from a photo set
Living that life is romantic, right?"
Rewind featuring bladee,"Sometimes, I just wanna rewind
Wanna turn back time to a different time, oh
Sometimes
I just wanna rewind, I just wanna rewind
I just wanna rewind (Press rewind)
Maybe I need a reality check
Sometimes now I just gotta say less
Count so well, drew lines on my chest
When I look in the mirror, I don't see no reflect
All this money makes me competitive
Gotta get more, living all excess
I must confess, I'm under stress
Turn back the time again
I must confеss, I'm under stress
I'm under prеssure in my head
I'm six feet down beneath myself
I'm tryna catch up with my breath
Even with everything on deck (Yeah, yeah)
I'm only thinking about less
Thinking how to move like chess (Yeah, yeah)
The mirror leaves me unimpressed
Maybe I need a reality check (Yeah, yeah)
Sometimes now I just gotta say less
Wanna see my face all up in the press
When I don't, sometimes I get a little bit depressed (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
L.A. makes me so competitive
Sometimes I wanna wake up dead
I must confess, I'm under stress
Turn back the time again
I'm in the hills, perfectly still
The sun is setting in my will
(Yeah, yeah)
My mind is split up like two bills
I pay for everything myself
I kill for everything I feel
360, find a way to deal

So I featuring a. g. cook,"Now I wanna think about all the good times
First met on the outskirts of Stockholm
All of your things in a black suitcase
First day, made Vroom Vroom in the basement
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Head bop hard with your arm up, dancing
Hot pink jacket on, music turned up
Bounce that track, make us late to the party
Now I wanna think about all the good times
First time I ever felt alive on stage
In Texas, in matching latex
That's as cool as I'm ever gonna feel
(Beautiful)
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Me and A.G. on Mulholland
Crazy Uber, straight from a video shoot
Got birthday cake on the way
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Best night ever in Arcosanti
So many friends right there in the audience
When I look back, what the fuck was I wearing?
Now I wanna think about all the good times
One big smile cracked the whole world open
Sipping green juice, looking so chic
Soft response while you play with the tension
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Like when we took Bibi down to Bubbles
Took our shoes off, ran around barefoot
Played that song we made that day
Now I wanna think about all the good times
DJ set back to back with Twiggy
She was nervous, you were so nice
Said you had the best time with her
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Me and Noonie
cried to your songs
No songs ever made us feel that much
Can't explain 'cause it's just too much
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Talking on Zoom in 2020
Red hair brushed out, sat back home
Lyrics back and forth from texts
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Like the first time I heard your music
My ex-boyfriend played your SoundCloud
That moment really changed my life
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no-o-o-o)
(No, no, no)
(No, no, no-o-o-o)
(No, no, no, no)
Now I wanna think about all the good times (No, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no)
Now I wanna think about all the good times (No, no, no, no)

Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good
Now I wanna think about all the good

Man, I don't know, I'm just a girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Yeah, I don't know if you like me
Sometimes I think you might hate me
Sometimes I think I might hate you
Maybe you just wanna be me
You always say, ""Let's go out""
So we go eat at a restaurant
Sometimes it feels a bit awkward
'Cause we don't have much in common
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
We talk about making music
But I don't know if it's honest
Can't tell if you wanna see me
Falling over and failing
And you can't tell what you're feeling
I think I know how you feel

Well, honestly, I was speechless
When I woke up to your voice note
You told me how you'd been feeling
Let's work it out on the remix
You'd always say, ""Let's go out""
But then I'd cancel last minute
I was so lost in my head
And scared to be in your pictures
'Cause for the last couple years
I've been at war with my body
I tried to starve myself thinner
And then I gained all the weight back
I was trapped in the hatred
And your life seemed so awesome
I never thought for a second
My voice was in your head
""Girl, you walk like a bitch""
When I was ten, someone said that
And it's just self-defence
Until you're building a weapon
She believed my projection
And now I totally get it
Forgot that inside the icon
There's still a young girl from Essex
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
It's you and me on the coin
The industry loves to spend
And when we put this to bed
The internet will go crazy
I'm glad I know how you feel
'Cause I ride for you, Charli (Charli, Charli)
