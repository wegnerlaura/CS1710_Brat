First met on the outskirts of Stockholm
All of your things in a black suitcase
First day, made Vroom Vroom in the basement
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Head bop hard with your arm up, dancing
Hot pink jacket on, music turned up
Bounce that track, make us late to the party
Now I wanna think about all the good times
First time I ever felt alive on stage
In Texas, in matching latex
That's as cool as I'm ever gonna feel
(Beautiful)
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Me and A.G. on Mulholland
Crazy Uber, straight from a video shoot
Got birthday cake on the way
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Best night ever in Arcosanti
So many friends right there in the audience
When I look back, what the fuck was I wearing?
Now I wanna think about all the good times
One big smile cracked the whole world open
Sipping green juice, looking so chic
Soft response while you play with the tension
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Like when we took Bibi down to Bubbles
Took our shoes off, ran around barefoot
Played that song we made that day
Now I wanna think about all the good times
DJ set back to back with Twiggy
She was nervous, you were so nice
Said you had the best time with her
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Me and Noonie
cried to your songs
No songs ever made us feel that much
Can't explain 'cause it's just too much
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Talking on Zoom in 2020
Red hair brushed out, sat back home
Lyrics back and forth from texts
Now I wanna think about all the good times
Like the first time I heard your music
My ex-boyfriend played your SoundCloud
That moment really changed my life

I tried to starve myself thinner
And then I gained all the weight back
I was trapped in the hatred
And your life seemed so awesome
I never thought for a second
My voice was in your head
""Girl, you walk like a bitch""
When I was ten, someone said that
And it's just self-defence
Until you're building a weapon
She believed my projection
And now I totally get it
Forgot that inside the icon
There's still a young girl from Essex
People say we're alike
They say we've got the same hair
It's you and me on the coin
The industry loves to spend
And when we put this to bed
The internet will go crazy

I've played this game before (Oh)
Fighting for a hopeless cause (Oh)
And now you're at my door (And now you're at my door, baby)
I've seen this trick before (I've seen it all before, yeah)
Here's one for the ones who left (Here's one for the ones who left)
One for the abandonment (One for the abandoned girls)
Fucked in a fun way we get (We really fucked it up, baby)
Kept it vague so you could guess
So you could work it out

Why do you choose to move?
('Cause maybe one day I might)
I'll take your silences
Fix 'em for customs, the signals makе motion
You're lonely and you're (Scarеd to run out of time)
And you're asking, ""When did it get so hard?""
Yeah (When did it get so hard? When did it get so hard?)
(When did it get so hard? When did it g—) Yeah
First off, you're bound to the album
Then you're locked into the promo
Next thing, three years have gone by (Scared to run out of time)
Me and George sit down and try to plan for our future
But there's so much guilt involved when we stop working
'Cause you're not supposed to stop when things start working, no
I found love, baby
But I was scared to run out of time
I think about it all the time
Was I made for this? I'm
Confused with all these feelings
I'm confused what's on my mind
When I make a sacrifice
Just in the nick of time
I'm so scared to run out of time
Oh, baby
I found love, I found
Does it all have to be so hard?
Sittin' here (When did it get so hard?)
And I'm exactly the same, but I'm older now
And I got even more stress on my body
So we had a conversation on the way home, ""Should I stop my birth control?
'Cause my career still feels small in the existential scheme of it all""
I'll tell you (Yeah), I folded up
My friends say (Yeah) I've fallen off
I'd be scared (Nothing's in your way)
Aren't you scared?
I'm so scared to run out of time
I'm so scared

Uh-uh
You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about

Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious

Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about
I wanna try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Kiss it, ride it, can I fit it?
